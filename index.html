                The name of the game is to beat the Bank, in the person of the Dealer, without exceeding 21. Otherwise you lose your bet. If you reach a Blackjack (21) your bet is multiplied by 3. If you beat the Dealer without reaching 21, you win double your bet.

                Although luck determines the hand you’re dealt, strategy has its role to play too. Depending on the hands of the other players and of the Bank, an informed player will know whether it’s wise to take another card, stop, or keep playing.

            <h4 id="cards_value">THE VALUE OF THE CARDS:  </h4>
            <p id="cards_value_inst">
                
            - From 2 to 9: each card has its own numerical value <br>

            - The 10s and the face cards, i.e. Jacks, Queens and Kings, are worth 10. <br>

            - The Ace is worth 1 or 11 depending on the player’s hand. If your hand does not exceed 21, the Ace counts as 11. If it does exceed 21, the Ace counts as 1. <br> The value of the Ace is always calculated to your advantage

            - The hand called ‘Blackjack’ is made up of an Ace and a card worth 10, making a total of 21, dealt in the player's first two cards.
